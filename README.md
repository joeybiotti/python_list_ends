# Python List Ends

Python console app. Within the app is a listed called `MakeList`, which contains: `5, 10, 15, 20, 25`. When the app the app runs, only the first and last integers are show in the console (5 and 25).

I found this exercise <a href="http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/04/25/12-list-ends.html">here</a>, where I found all the other fun python exercises.
